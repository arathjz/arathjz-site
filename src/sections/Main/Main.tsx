          I am a software engineer passionate about providing solutions in
          technology products; I work mainly with frontend applications, but I
          have experience as a full-stack engineer. I believe that every
          application should be easy to use and accessible to anyone, which
          leads me to put special care into user experience, accessibility, and
          design. ðŸš€
