            I build software, am a finance enthusiast, and love coffee (I even
            have coffee tattoos). I work mainly with frontend applications, but
            I have experience as a full-stack engineer. I believe that every
            application should be easy to use and accessible to anyone, which
            leads me to put special care into user experience, accessibility,
            and design ðŸš€
